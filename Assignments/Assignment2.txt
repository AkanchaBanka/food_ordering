● - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
These are both bundlers for web applications. They transform the our raw code into optimized files that
browser and understand and display.

● - What is `.parcel-cache`
Parcel cache is used by parcel to reduce the bulding time. It stores infromation about project when it builds it,
sot hat when it rebuilds it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze everything from the scratch.


● - What is `npx` ?
executes the package without installing

● - What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`
devDependencies are used for development builds

● - What is Tree Shaking?
It is a technique to eliminate dead/unused code

● - What is Hot Module Replacement?
It's a feature that is used to only update part of the application without refreshing the entire page.
This makes it faster and don’t lose your current progress or have to reload everything to see changes.

● - List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your
own words.
Minification- minimizing code and markuo in you web pages and files
Caching- Caches during development

● - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
.gitignore is a place where we add fles that we don't want to push to our git repo.
Usually files that can be installed are placed in this.
When we do a git commit, these files are ignored.

● - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
package.json: defines the project dependencies, can be edit by developers
package-lock.json: locks the exact verion, managed by npm

● - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
Manual changes can cause inconsistencies and verison conflicts. 
Always update package.json and npm will handle the lock file.

● - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
Node_modules is a directory created by npm to store all the dependencies and sub-dependencies required for our project.
We do not push it on git because it is large and can be re-installed as dependencies are already defined in package.json.
Some dependencies might also be platform specific. 

● - What is the `dist` folder?
contains production ready and compiled version of your code, generated by bundlers like parcel or webpack.

● - What is `browserlists`
List of browsers that are definitely supported by the application.
